# webpack4-sandbox
Examples for Webpack 4, my experiments based on official docs and other sources.

Top(root) folders in this repository are named after the sources of information, where examples or articles were found.

For example, folder `"webpack.js.org"` contains examples(and my experiments) from [webpack.js.org](webpack.js.org "Official Webpack docs").

Nested folders, which contain individual examples use folder naming like this:
```
<YYYY-MM-DD> - <Experiment name>
```
Where `<YYYY-MM-DD>` is folder creation date.
